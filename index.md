## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

I think this was my favorite la, it was siimple and a foundation that helped me to learn all the basic commands t Learning al the git commands and linux commands was very important as it helped me have a better understanding of the whole class. Overall a necessary lab toget into the class.

* Lab 3 part 1

This was another simple lab that helped me understand other labs better. Using double and std:cout to print the unit price of the pizza was a good way of learning how code works. Another thng I enjoyed about this lab was with how helpful my partner was in making sure I knew how to write the code and if I understood it well.

* Lab 9 part 1

Like I said before the previous lab 3 was very helpful in making me understand and better succeed in this class. With this lab we used everything we learned from lab 1-8 to incorporate into this lab. I enjoyed learning how to use tables and make a more complicated software.
